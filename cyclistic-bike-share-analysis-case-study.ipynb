How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\nTool followed:- Excel(Power-Pivot & Power Query), R,\n\n## Prepare\n\nData set obtained from the link \nData set from Quarter # 2 of 2019 to Quarter # 1 of 2020 were downloaded from the link and stored on the local desktop.\n\n## Process\nFollowing steps were performed in the R platform, and the final file was extracted for final analysis \n1. Made the columns’ name uniform across the file\n2. Before merging the files, remove any extra columns that are not common to all files. \n3. Merge the column into one file using the full outer join \nRename the row from Subscriber/member to Member and Customer / casual to Non-Member\n4. Identified the outliers and recorded outliers in a separate column as “Outliers.”\n5. Extracted the file as CSV, and the same file was used for the analysis\nThe file was ready to use for the analysis.\n\n## Pre-Data analysis:- we created the following columns \n1. Ride Length in Minutes – This was done by subtracting the ride’s start time from to end time. \n2. Weekday – calculated from the start time column \n3. Day name – calculated from the start time column\n4. Day number – calculated from the start time column\n5. Yea-Month-Quarter -  calculated from the start time column\n6. Similar way Month number, month name and quarters were created","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load Required

To increase the number of rides for short, long duration and encourage the non-member into a membership program. These are: \n\n2. Members observed two picks from 6 am to 7 am and 3 pm to 5 pm. Most of the members are employees used for their respective office or factory commute. The rides time is concise duration, and the non-member used rides from 9 am to 5 pm. The mean ride is higher, indicating that the non-members use the ride for a more extended period than members. \n\n3. We could encourage non-members for shorter rides by giving a discount or coupon through the membership program. \n\n4. Members take lesser rides during the weekend than on weekdays. We could encourage the members to ride during the weekend with the family package for longer duration rides. Alternatively, we can also give either a discount or promotion to the members on weekends for a short duration. \n\n5. June and July are the picks in the rides for both members and non-members. June and July periods are for summer vacations. We need to have discounts and promotions for this specific period to increase the trips and convert the non-member into a membership program. \n\n6. November and December are Christmas time and rides increase for non-members discount or promotion package is an excellent idea to increase the rides.\n\n7.
